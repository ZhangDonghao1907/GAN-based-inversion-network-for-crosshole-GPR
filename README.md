# GAN-based-inversion-network-for-crosshole-GPR
A GAN-based inversion network to directly translate crosshole GPR into permittivity map.
The mian.py contains the complete code of the GAN-based inversion network. You can use the crosshole GPR data generated by the dataset.py to train this inversion network or use your own data to train it
